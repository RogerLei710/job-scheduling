# Summary of work in TrendMicro for the past three months

When I started work as an intern, I learned how to work in `Scrum` development, an agile way to manage a project. Since Scrum model suggests that projects progress via a series of `sprints`, we have sprint planning meetings every two weeks, describing the desired set of features to be developed in the next sprint. And we use the amazing tool `JIRA` to help us easily manage our product backlog and active sprints. Our product owner prioritizes the backlog so the we always work on the most valuable features first. On each day of the sprint, all of my team members attend a daily Scrum meeting. This meeting is timeboxed to no more than 15 minutes. During that time, we share what we worked on the prior day, will work on that day, and identify any impediments to progress. It is the time for us to synchronize our work. At the end of every sprint, we conduct a sprint review during which we demonstrate the new functionality to our product users, reflect on the sprint that has ended, and identify opportunities to improve.

    Scrum relies on a self-organizing, cross-functional team. The scrum team is self-organizing in that there is no overall team leader who decides which person will do which task or how a problem will be solved. Those are issues that are decided by the team as a whole.

    And in Scrum, a team is cross functional, meaning everyone is needed to take a feature from idea to implementation.
