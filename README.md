* This is my graduate project aiming to solve two dimensional job scheduling problem.
## Steps
1. Implement **brand and bound** algorithm to find the optimal scheduling in which jobs are finished using the smallest amount of time.
2. Build a **neural network** model to simulate the exact algorithm in **1**.
3. Compare performance between the exact algorithm, the neural network and some other classic heuristic scheduling algorithms.
